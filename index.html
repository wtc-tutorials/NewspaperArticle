        >In a shocking development for both scientists and local pet owners, a house cat named Mr. Whiskers has
        reportedly discovered a new form of renewable energy — by knocking over a fishbowl. The chain reaction that
        followed somehow powered every appliance on the block for eight minutes straight.</p
      >
      <p class="text"
        >Experts are still baffled, describing the breakthrough as “scientifically impossible but undeniably adorable.”
        Meanwhile, Mr. Whiskers has shown no interest in giving interviews, preferring to nap on top of the now-famous
        fishbowl. Residents are calling him “the purr-fect genius” who just might save the planet—between naps, of
        course.</p
